# MPhys-Dissertation-Code
This repository contains the code used in the analysis for the undergraduate MPhys project: The Missing Multipole Problem: Biases in GW Analysis.

# Project Overview
The project investigates how neglecting higher-order multipoles in waveform models can bias parameter estimation for binary black hole mergers using Bayesian inference tools.
