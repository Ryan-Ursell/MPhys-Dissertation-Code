# MPhys-Dissertation-Code
This repository contains the code used in the analysis for the undergraduate MPhys project:

**_The Missing Multipole Problem: Biases in Gravitational Wave Analysis._**

## Project Overview
The project investigates how neglecting higher-order multipoles in waveform models can bias parameter estimation for binary black hole mergers using Bayesian inference tools.

This project investigates how neglecting higher-order multipoles in waveform models can bias parameter estimation for binary black hole mergers, using Bayesian inference tools such as `bilby`.
